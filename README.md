This is for learning create an E-commeric shopping website using react and reduct(maybe idk)

1. git config: 我也不知道怎么搞 但是我搞出来了！
1.5 code in master branch and don't forget to merge into main branch~~
2. turn on the website by "npm start"
if not working, run: npm install
3. OK Let's start!
4. For backend database, using firebase, just google it and create a new project with the same name and this project
5. Follow the instruction and don't forget add sudo before that command like sudo npm install firebase
6. install es7 react and reduct in the extension and it allows you create a class just by typing "rfce" to create a .js file~
